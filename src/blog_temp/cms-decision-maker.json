  "content": "# CMS Decision Maker: Content-as-Code vs Traditional CMS in the AI Era\n\nThe CMS decision used to be simple: need content management? Buy a CMS. But the landscape has changed. AI coding agents can write Markdown. Git workflows make content versioning trivial. Developer teams are questioning whether they need CMS abstraction at all.\n\nThe reality is more nuanced. Some teams need traditional CMSs. Others should use headless CMSs. And increasingly, teams should use content-as-code (Markdown in Git). The question is which fits your team, workflow, and content needs.\n\nThe [CMS Decision Maker](https://krischase.com/cms-decision) helps you evaluate your situation and make the right call.\n\n## Why the CMS Decision Matters More Now\n\nTraditional CMSs add abstraction layers. They require APIs, admin interfaces, preview systems, and content models. That abstraction was valuable when non-technical teams couldn't edit code. But AI coding agents change the equation.\n\nIf developers can use AI to edit Markdown files directly, why add CMS abstraction? If Git provides versioning, workflows, and collaboration, why add CMS workflows? If static site generators handle content, why add a CMS backend?\n\nThe answer depends on who updates content, how often, what complexity you need, and whether your team benefits from CMS abstraction.\n\n## The Three Options\n\nModern teams have three viable paths:\n\n### Content-as-Code (No CMS)\n\nContent lives in your Git repository as Markdown files. Developers or AI agents edit files directly. Git provides versioning, workflows, and collaboration. Static site generators build the site.\n\n**When It Makes Sense:**\n- Developers or AI agents update content\n- Content updates are infrequent or predictable\n- Your team is comfortable with Git workflows\n- Content is relatively simple (text, images, basic structure)\n- You want maximum control and minimal abstraction\n- Budget is constrained\n- You're using static site generators (Next.js, Gatsby, Hugo)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- No CMS costs\n- Full control over content structure\n- Git provides versioning and workflows\n- No API dependencies\n- Faster builds (no CMS API calls)\n- Content and code live together\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Non-technical teams can't easily update content\n- No built-in preview system\n- More complex i18n workflows\n- Requires developer involvement for content changes\n\n### Headless CMS\n\nContent lives in a CMS backend. Your site consumes content via API. Non-technical teams can update content. Developers control presentation.\n\n**When It Makes Sense:**\n- Non-technical teams update content frequently\n- Content complexity is moderate (structured content, relationships)\n- You need preview capabilities\n- Multiple channels consume the same content (web, mobile, etc.)\n- You want content management without presentation coupling\n- Your team has frontend expertise but needs content editing\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Non-technical teams can update content\n- Preview systems available\n- Structured content models\n- Multi-channel content delivery\n- Separation of content and presentation\n\n**Limitations:**\n- CMS costs ($100-$500+/month typically)\n- API dependency (slower builds, potential downtime)\n- Vendor lock-in risk\n- More complex architecture\n- Still requires developer involvement for schema changes\n\n### Traditional CMS\n\nFull-stack CMS with database, admin interface, themes, and plugins. Content and presentation are coupled.\n\n**When It Makes Sense:**\n- Non-technical teams own content completely\n- High content complexity (rich media, complex relationships)\n- You need extensive i18n support\n- Content updates are frequent and unpredictable\n- You want minimal developer involvement\n- You're building content-heavy sites (blogs, marketing sites)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Complete non-technical control\n- Rich media management\n- Extensive plugin ecosystems\n- Built-in preview and workflows\n- Proven for content-heavy sites\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Highest cost and complexity\n- Vendor lock-in\n- Slower performance typically\n- Less flexibility in presentation\n- More maintenance burden\n\nThe [CMS Decision Maker](https://krischase.com/cms-decision) evaluates your team capabilities, content update frequency, content complexity, and technical requirements to recommend the right path.\n\n## Key Decision Factors\n\nThe framework evaluates several critical factors:\n\n### Who Updates Content?\n\n**Developers or AI agents:** Content-as-code likely fits\n**Non-technical teams:** Headless or traditional CMS needed\n**Mixed team:** Headless CMS often best\n\nThe tool assesses who actually updates content and how technical they are.\n\n### Content Update Frequency\n\n**Infrequent (monthly or less):** Content-as-code works fine\n**Moderate (weekly):** Headless CMS often best\n**Frequent (daily or more):** Traditional or headless CMS needed\n\nUpdate frequency determines whether CMS workflows justify the abstraction cost.\n\n### Content Complexity\n\n**Simple (text, images, basic structure):** Content-as-code sufficient\n**Moderate (structured content, relationships):** Headless CMS often best\n**Complex (rich media, complex relationships, i18n):** Traditional CMS may be needed\n\nComplexity determines whether you need CMS features or if Markdown is enough.\n\n### Team Capabilities\n\n**Strong developer team:** Content-as-code viable\n**Mixed technical/non-technical:** Headless CMS often best\n**Primarily non-technical:** Traditional CMS may be needed\n\nTeam capabilities determine what workflows are feasible.\n\n### Budget Constraints\n\n**Limited budget:** Content-as-code (free)\n**Moderate budget:** Headless CMS ($100-$500/month)\n**Healthy budget:** Traditional CMS ($500-$2000+/month)\n\nBudget affects what options are viable, but needs should drive the decision.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n**Static site generation:** Content-as-code or headless CMS\n**Multi-channel delivery:** Headless CMS\n**Complex i18n:** Traditional or headless CMS\n**Preview requirements:** Headless or traditional CMS\n\nThe tool synthesizes these factors into a recommendation.\n\n## The AI Coding Agent Factor\n\nAI coding agents change the CMS equation. If developers can use AI to edit Markdown files, the barrier to content-as-code is lower. Non-technical teams might even use AI-assisted editing.\n\nThis doesn't eliminate CMSs, but it shifts when they make sense:\n\n- If AI can handle content updates, CMS abstraction is less valuable\n- If non-technical teams need direct editing, CMSs still make sense\n- If content complexity is high, CMS features still matter\n\nThe tool considers whether AI coding agents affect your team's capabilities.\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\nI've used this framework to help teams make the right decision:\n\n**Developer-Focused SaaS:** 5-person dev team, marketing site, infrequent updates. Recommendation: Content-as-code. They use Markdown in Git, developers update content with AI assistance, saved $500/month on CMS costs.\n\n**E-commerce Platform:** Marketing team updates content daily, needs preview, multi-channel delivery. Recommendation: Headless CMS. They use Contentful, marketing team updates content independently, developers control presentation.\n\n**Content-Heavy Blog:** Editorial team, rich media, complex i18n, frequent updates. Recommendation: Traditional CMS. They use WordPress, editorial team has full control, minimal developer involvement needed.\n\n**B2B SaaS:** Mixed team, moderate content complexity, weekly updates, needs preview. Recommendation: Headless CMS. They use Sanity, marketing updates content, developers control frontend.\n\nIn each case, the recommendation matched actual content management needs.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\nTeams make predictable mistakes:\n\n**Using CMS When Content-as-Code Would Work:** Paying for CMS abstraction when developers could edit Markdown directly\n\n**Using Content-as-Code When CMS Needed:** Forcing non-technical teams to use Git when CMS would be better\n\n**Choosing Traditional When Headless Would Work:** Over-abstracting when headless CMS provides the needed separation\n\n**Ignoring Team Capabilities:** Choosing based on features instead of who actually updates content\n\n**Ignoring Budget:** Choosing expensive CMS when simpler option would work\n\nThe tool helps avoid these mistakes by evaluating needs objectively.\n\n## Migration Considerations\n\nIf you're using the wrong approach, consider migration:\n\n**CMS → Content-as-Code:** Export content to Markdown, set up Git workflows, train team\n\n**Content-as-Code → CMS:** Set up CMS, migrate content, train non-technical teams\n\n**Traditional → Headless:** Decouple content from presentation, set up headless CMS, migrate content\n\nMigration is possible but has cost. The tool helps you choose right the first time.\n\n## Final Thought\n\nThe CMS decision isn't just about features—it's about who updates content, how often, and what workflows fit your team. AI coding agents have changed the equation, but CMSs still have their place.\n\nUse the [CMS Decision Maker](https://krischase.com/cms-decision) to evaluate your specific situation. Get a recommendation based on your team, content needs, and technical requirements.\n\nChoosing the right content management approach saves costs, improves workflows, and ensures content stays maintainable as your team grows. Get it right, and content updates are smooth. Get it wrong, and you're paying for abstraction you don't need, or forcing teams into workflows that don't fit.\n\nThe framework helps you make the right call.",
