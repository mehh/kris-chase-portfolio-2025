  "content": "# EOS Goal Cascade Analyzer: Align Company Goals with Departmental Execution\n\nYour company has a goal. Each department has rocks (quarterly priorities). But do departmental rocks actually support the company goal? Too often, departments work on important things that don't move the company forward.\n\nThis misalignment is invisible but expensive. Engineering ships features. Sales hits quotas. Marketing generates leads. But if their work doesn't connect to company goals, you're busy but not effective.\n\nThe [EOS Goal Cascade Analyzer](https://krischase.com/eos-cascade) helps you cascade company goals into departmental rocks (top-down) or analyze whether existing rocks align with company goals (bottom-up). Based on the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) framework.\n\n## The Alignment Problem\n\nMisalignment between company goals and departmental work is common:\n\n**Engineering ships features** that don't impact company metrics\n\n**Sales hits quotas** that don't drive strategic objectives\n\n**Marketing generates leads** that don't convert to the right customers\n\n**Product builds features** that don't move the company forward\n\nEveryone works hard. But if departmental work doesn't connect to company goals, you're spinning wheels.\n\nThe cost isn't just wasted effort—it's missed opportunities, delayed goals, and teams feeling like their work doesn't matter.\n\n## The EOS Framework\n\nThe Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) provides a framework for goal alignment:\n\n### Company Goals\n\nCompany goals are the 1-3 most important objectives for the quarter. They're measurable, achievable, and strategic. Every department should contribute to them.\n\n### Departmental Rocks\n\nRocks are quarterly priorities (3-7 per department). They're specific, measurable, and achievable. They should cascade from company goals.\n\n### Goal Cascade\n\nTop-down: Company goals → Departmental rocks. Each department identifies rocks that directly support company goals.\n\nBottom-up: Departmental rocks → Company goals. Analyze whether existing rocks align with company goals.\n\nThe [EOS Goal Cascade Analyzer](https://krischase.com/eos-cascade) supports both approaches.\n\n## How the Analyzer Works\n\nThe tool supports two modes:\n\n### Top-Down: Goal Cascade\n\nStart with company goals and cascade them into departmental rocks:\n\n**1. Define Company Goal:** What's the most important objective this quarter?\n\n**2. Identify Departments:** Which departments need to contribute?\n\n**3. Generate Rocks:** The tool analyzes the company goal and recommends departmental rocks that support it\n\n**4. Evaluate Alignment:** Assess how well recommended rocks align with the company goal\n\n**5. Refine Rocks:** Adjust recommendations to fit department capacity and constraints\n\nThis ensures departmental work directly supports company objectives.\n\n### Bottom-Up: Alignment Analysis\n\nStart with existing departmental rocks and analyze alignment:\n\n**1. Define Company Goal:** What's the company's most important objective?\n\n**2. List Departmental Rocks:** What are departments already planning to work on?\n\n**3. Analyze Alignment:** The tool evaluates how well existing rocks support the company goal\n\n**4. Identify Gaps:** Find rocks that don't align and need adjustment\n\n**5. Recommend Changes:** Get suggestions for aligning misaligned rocks\n\nThis helps you identify and fix misalignment in existing plans.\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\nI've used this framework to improve goal alignment:\n\n**Top-Down Example:** Company goal: \"Increase MRR by 20%.\" The analyzer recommended:\n- Sales: Close $X in new deals\n- Product: Ship features that reduce churn\n- Marketing: Generate leads from target segments\n- Engineering: Improve conversion funnel\nEach department had rocks that directly supported the company goal.\n\n**Bottom-Up Example:** Company goal: \"Improve product-market fit.\" Existing rocks included engineering infrastructure work that didn't support the goal. The analyzer identified the misalignment and recommended shifting engineering rocks to user research and feature iteration.\n\n**Alignment Fix:** Company goal: \"Expand to new market.\" Marketing was planning brand campaigns that didn't support expansion. The analyzer identified the gap and recommended shifting marketing rocks to market research and entry strategy.\n\nIn each case, better alignment led to faster goal achievement.\n\n## Key Alignment Principles\n\nThe analyzer uses these principles to evaluate alignment:\n\n### Direct Contribution\n\nRocks should directly contribute to company goals. If a rock doesn't move a company goal metric, it's misaligned.\n\n### Measurable Impact\n\nRocks should have measurable outcomes that connect to company goal metrics. Vague rocks are harder to align.\n\n### Appropriate Scope\n\nRocks should be achievable within the quarter. Overly ambitious rocks risk missing company goals.\n\n### Department Capacity\n\nRocks should fit department capacity. Unrealistic rocks lead to missed goals.\n\n### Strategic Priority\n\nRocks should be the highest-priority work for achieving company goals, not just important work.\n\nThe tool evaluates rocks against these principles.\n\n## Common Alignment Mistakes\n\nTeams make predictable alignment mistakes:\n\n**Vague Company Goals:** Goals that aren't specific enough to cascade into rocks\n\n**Misaligned Rocks:** Important work that doesn't support company goals\n\n**Too Many Rocks:** Departments with 10+ rocks, diluting focus\n\n**Missing Departments:** Not cascading goals to all relevant departments\n\n**No Alignment Check:** Setting rocks without checking if they support company goals\n\n**Set and Forget:** Not reviewing alignment throughout the quarter\n\nThe analyzer helps avoid these mistakes.\n\n## Using the Tool\n\nThe [EOS Goal Cascade Analyzer](https://krischase.com/eos-cascade) provides:\n\n**Alignment Score:** How well departmental rocks align with company goals (0-100)\n\n**Cascade Recommendations:** Suggested rocks for each department that support company goals\n\n**Alignment Analysis:** Evaluation of existing rocks' alignment with company goals\n\n**Gap Identification:** Rocks that don't align and need adjustment\n\n**Refinement Suggestions:** Recommendations for improving alignment\n\nUse the tool at the start of each quarter to ensure alignment, or mid-quarter to check and fix misalignment.\n\n## Integration with EOS\n\nThe tool complements EOS processes:\n\n**Quarterly Planning:** Use top-down cascade when setting quarterly rocks\n\n**Rock Reviews:** Use bottom-up analysis during weekly rock reviews\n\n**Goal Tracking:** Monitor alignment as you track progress toward company goals\n\n**Annual Planning:** Use cascade when setting annual company goals and quarterly rocks\n\nThe tool fits into existing EOS workflows.\n\n## Measuring Success\n\nTrack alignment outcomes:\n\n**Goal Achievement:** Do company goals get achieved faster with better alignment?\n\n**Department Effectiveness:** Do departments feel their work matters more?\n\n**Execution Speed:** Do initiatives execute faster when aligned?\n\n**Team Morale:** Do teams feel more connected to company objectives?\n\nOver time, you'll see the impact of better goal alignment.\n\n## Final Thought\n\nCompany goals without departmental alignment are wishes. Departmental rocks without company goal connection are busywork. Real execution requires connecting the two.\n\nUse the [EOS Goal Cascade Analyzer](https://krischase.com/eos-cascade) to ensure departmental work supports company goals. Cascade goals top-down or analyze alignment bottom-up. Either way, make sure everyone's work moves the company forward.\n\nGoal alignment isn't bureaucracy—it's execution effectiveness. When departmental rocks support company goals, you achieve objectives faster. When they don't, you're busy but not effective.\n\nThe analyzer helps you get alignment right.",
