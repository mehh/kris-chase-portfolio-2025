  "content": "# Build vs Buy: The Executive Decision Framework That Saves Millions\n\nEvery executive faces the same question dozens of times per year: should we build this internally or buy a solution? It's a decision that can make or break budgets, timelines, and engineering velocity. Yet most companies approach it with gut instinct and incomplete information.\n\nI've watched companies waste millions building custom solutions when off-the-shelf tools would work perfectly. I've also seen teams buy expensive platforms when a simple internal solution would be faster and cheaper. The problem isn't the decision itself—it's the lack of a structured framework to evaluate it.\n\nThat's why I built the [Build vs Buy Solver](https://krischase.com/build-vs-buy), an executive-level assessment tool that helps you make the right call based on your team, timeline, and risk profile.\n\n## The Hidden Cost of Getting It Wrong\n\nGetting the build vs buy decision wrong has real consequences. Build when you should buy, and you're committing your engineering team to months of work maintaining something that doesn't differentiate your business. Buy when you should build, and you're paying license fees for functionality you could own—often with vendor lock-in as a bonus.\n\nThe real cost isn't just the immediate spend. It's the opportunity cost of engineering time that could have been spent on core product features. It's the technical debt of maintaining custom solutions. It's the risk of vendor dependency when the capability is strategic to your business.\n\nMost frameworks focus only on cost comparison. They ignore differentiation, timeline pressure, maintenance capacity, and risk tolerance—the factors that actually matter for executive decisions.\n\n## What Makes This Framework Different\n\nThe Build vs Buy Solver evaluates seven critical dimensions that determine the right answer:\n\n### 1. Differentiation Level\n\nIs this capability core to your competitive advantage? If your entire business model depends on it, build. If it's table stakes that every competitor has, buy. The tool assesses where your need falls on this spectrum.\n\n### 2. Timeline Pressure\n\nReal deadlines change the math. A 3-month deadline favors buying. A 12-month timeline might favor building if the maintenance burden is manageable. The framework weighs urgency against long-term ownership.\n\n### 3. Team Size and Expertise\n\nA 50-person engineering team can afford to maintain custom solutions. A 5-person team probably can't. The tool evaluates whether you have the capacity to build and maintain something internally.\n\n### 4. Budget Constraints\n\nBudget isn't just about upfront cost. It's about total cost of ownership—licenses, maintenance, opportunity cost. The framework considers both the immediate spend and ongoing commitment.\n\n### 5. Maintenance Capacity\n\nThis is where most frameworks fall short. Building something means maintaining it forever. Do you have engineers who can support this long-term? The tool evaluates your ongoing capacity, not just your initial ability to build.\n\n### 6. Risk Assessment\n\nWhat happens if you're wrong? If the capability is critical and building fails, what's the impact? If buying fails, can you switch vendors? The framework evaluates the downside risk of each path.\n\n### 7. Existing Solutions\n\nThe market matters. If there are mature, well-supported solutions that meet 80% of your needs, that changes the equation. The tool considers what's already available and how well it fits.\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nI've used this framework to help companies avoid expensive mistakes:\n\n- A fintech company was about to build a custom payment processor. The framework recommended buying Stripe with custom fraud detection—saving 18 months of engineering time and $500K in development costs.\n\n- A SaaS company was ready to buy a $50K/year analytics platform. The framework recommended building a lightweight internal solution that fit their exact needs—saving $50K/year and avoiding vendor lock-in.\n\n- A startup was building custom infrastructure monitoring when Datadog would work. The framework recommended buying, freeing the engineering team to focus on product features that differentiated the business.\n\nThe framework doesn't just give you an answer—it explains the reasoning, highlights the tradeoffs, and provides confidence levels so you know when to dig deeper.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe [Build vs Buy Solver](https://krischase.com/build-vs-buy) uses AI-powered analysis to evaluate your specific situation. You answer questions about what you're building, your team's capacity, timeline pressure, and risk tolerance. The tool analyzes your inputs and provides:\n\n- A clear recommendation (Build or Buy) with confidence level\n- Detailed reasoning explaining why\n- Tradeoff analysis showing what you gain and lose with each option\n- Risk assessment for both paths\n- Timeline and cost estimates\n- Next steps for execution\n\nThe analysis updates in real-time as you refine your inputs, so you can see how different factors change the recommendation. Want to see what happens if your timeline extends by 3 months? Just adjust the input and watch the analysis update.\n\n## When to Use This Framework\n\nUse the Build vs Buy Solver for any significant capability decision:\n\n- Infrastructure: databases, CDNs, monitoring, logging\n- Services: payments, authentication, email, notifications\n- Platforms: analytics, CRM, customer support tools\n- Features: search, real-time features, admin dashboards\n- Integrations: third-party APIs, data pipelines\n\nIf it requires more than a week of engineering time, it's worth running through the framework. The 5 minutes you spend on the assessment can save months of work or hundreds of thousands in unnecessary spend.\n\n## Making the Decision Stick\n\nOnce you have the recommendation, share the analysis with your team. The tool generates shareable results that explain the reasoning in terms stakeholders understand. When engineers question why you're buying instead of building, you have data-backed reasoning. When finance questions why you're building instead of buying, you have cost and timeline analysis.\n\n## Common Patterns\n\nOver years of using this framework, I've noticed consistent patterns:\n\n**Always Buy:** Payment processing, email delivery, CDN, basic analytics, authentication (unless it's your core product)\n\n**Usually Build:** Core product features, proprietary algorithms, unique workflows, strategic integrations\n\n**Depends on Context:** Admin dashboards, reporting, monitoring, CRM, customer support tools\n\nThe framework helps you navigate the \"depends\" category with data instead of debate.\n\n## Final Thought\n\nThe build vs buy decision isn't binary—it's nuanced. The right answer depends on your team, timeline, budget, and business strategy. Gut instinct and cost comparison spreadsheets aren't enough.\n\nUse the [Build vs Buy Solver](https://krischase.com/build-vs-buy) for your next major capability decision. Five minutes of structured analysis can save months of engineering time or hundreds of thousands in unnecessary spend. In executive decision-making, that's the difference between strategic thinking and expensive guesswork.",
