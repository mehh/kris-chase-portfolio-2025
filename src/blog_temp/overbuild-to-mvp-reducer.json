  "content": "# Overbuild to MVP Reducer: How to Rescue Your Launch When You've Gone Too Far\n\nYou've been building for months. The feature list keeps growing. The launch date keeps slipping. You know you're overbuilt, but cutting features feels impossible. Where do you even start?\n\nI've been there. So have most product teams. You start with good intentions, scope creeps in, and before you know it, you're six months in with no launch in sight.\n\nThe good news: it's not too late. You can still cut back to an MVP and launch. The [Overbuild to MVP Reducer](https://krischase.com/overbuild-reducer) gives you a step-by-step plan to trim scope without killing your product.\n\n## How You Got Here\n\nOverbuilding happens gradually. One feature at a time. One \"this would be nice\" decision at a time. Before you realize it, you've committed to features that don't matter for launch.\n\nCommon patterns:\n\n**Scope Creep:** Features that seemed essential when you started now feel like bloat, but you've already built them.\n\n**Fear of Launching:** The closer you get to launch, the more you want to add \"just one more thing\" to make it perfect.\n\n**Stakeholder Requests:** Sales wants this feature. Customer success wants that one. Engineering wants to build it right. Everyone's requests add up.\n\n**Lack of Prioritization:** Without clear criteria for what matters, everything feels important. You can't cut because you can't decide what to cut.\n\n**Perfectionism:** \"It's almost done\" turns into \"just a few more weeks\" turns into months of polish.\n\nThe first step to recovery is recognizing you're overbuilt. The second step is having a systematic way to cut.\n\n## The Cutting Framework\n\nCutting features isn't about arbitrary decisions. It's about methodical reduction based on clear criteria:\n\n### 1. What's Core vs. What's Nice-to-Have\n\nYour MVP needs exactly one thing: the core value proposition working well enough that users get value. Everything else can wait.\n\nAsk: \"If we launched with only this feature, would users get value?\" If the answer is yes for a feature, it's core. If the answer is no, it can wait.\n\n### 2. What's Validated vs. What's Assumed\n\nCut features based on assumptions. Keep features based on validation. If you haven't validated that users need a feature, cut it.\n\nLaunch with validated needs. Build assumed needs after you have users.\n\n### 3. What's Blocking vs. What's Enhancing\n\nSome features block launch. Others enhance the experience. Cut enhancements, keep blockers.\n\nAuthentication blocks launch if you need user accounts. Two-factor authentication enhances security but doesn't block launch.\n\n### 4. What's Fast vs. What's Slow\n\nIf cutting a feature saves weeks and launching without it is feasible, cut it. Time to market matters more than feature completeness.\n\n### 5. What Users Need vs. What You Want\n\nYou might want advanced analytics, but users need the core workflow. Cut what you want, keep what users need.\n\nThe [Overbuild to MVP Reducer](https://krischase.com/overbuild-reducer) applies these criteria to your feature list and generates a cutting plan.\n\n## How the Reducer Works\n\nThe tool analyzes your current scope and provides:\n\n**Feature Categorization:** Which features are core, which are nice-to-have, which can be deferred\n\n**Cutting Plan:** Specific features to remove with reasoning for each cut\n\n**Timeline Impact:** How much time you'll save by cutting each category\n\n**Risk Assessment:** What happens if you launch without each feature\n\n**Reduced Scope:** Your new MVP feature list with timeline estimates\n\nYou provide your current features, timeline constraints, team capacity, and user feedback. The tool uses AI to analyze what you can safely cut and generates a reduction plan.\n\n## Real-World Recovery Stories\n\nI've helped teams recover from overbuilding:\n\n**SaaS Platform:** A team had built 40 features over 8 months with no launch. The reducer identified 24 features to cut. They launched with 16 features in 2 weeks, got users, then rebuilt the cut features based on actual usage.\n\n**Mobile App:** An app had feature parity with competitors before launch. The reducer recommended launching with core workflow only. They launched in 3 weeks instead of 6 months, got users, then added features users actually requested.\n\n**B2B Tool:** A B2B product had admin features, reporting, and integrations before core workflow. The reducer recommended cutting everything except core workflow. They launched in 4 weeks, got paying customers, then built admin features when customers asked.\n\nIn every case, cutting led to faster launches and better products.\n\n## What to Cut First\n\nCertain features are almost always safe to cut:\n\n**Admin Features:** Dashboards, analytics, user management—build these after you have users who need them.\n\n**Edge Cases:** Features for 5% of users can wait. Launch for the 95% first.\n\n**Polish:** Animations, transitions, perfect UI—launch functional, polish later.\n\n**Integrations:** Third-party integrations can wait. Launch core functionality first.\n\n**Advanced Features:** Permissions, RBAC, multi-tenancy—start simple, add complexity later.\n\n**Mobile Apps:** Launch web first, build native when web proves demand.\n\nThe tool identifies these patterns and recommends cutting them first.\n\n## Cutting Without Killing Morale\n\nCutting features is demoralizing. Engineers spent time building them. Product spent time designing them. Cutting feels like wasted work.\n\nFrame cuts as learning, not failure:\n\n**\"We're launching to learn\"** not \"We're cutting because we failed\"\n\n**\"We'll rebuild based on real usage\"** not \"We're throwing away work\"\n\n**\"Faster launch means faster learning\"** not \"We're rushing to launch\"\n\n**\"Users will tell us what matters\"** not \"We don't know what to build\"\n\nShare the reducer's analysis with your team. Show the timeline impact. Emphasize that cutting means launching, and launching means learning.\n\n## The Cutting Process\n\nUse the reducer's plan, but execute systematically:\n\n**1. Review the Cutting Plan**\n\nUnderstand why each feature is being cut. The tool provides reasoning, but make sure it aligns with your product strategy.\n\n**2. Validate with Stakeholders**\n\nShare the plan with stakeholders. Use the tool's risk assessment to address concerns. \"We can launch without this, and here's what happens if users need it.\"\n\n**3. Execute the Cuts**\n\nRemove cut features from the codebase. Don't just hide them—delete them. Dead code slows development.\n\n**4. Adjust Timeline**\n\nRecalculate your launch timeline based on the reduced scope. The tool provides estimates, but verify with your team.\n\n**5. Launch Fast**\n\nDon't add new features during the cut. Launch the reduced scope as quickly as possible.\n\n**6. Learn and Rebuild**\n\nAfter launch, see what users actually use. Rebuild cut features only if users need them.\n\n## Metrics That Matter\n\nTrack the impact of cutting:\n\n**Time to Launch:** How much faster did cutting make your launch?\n\n**Feature Usage:** After launch, which cut features do users actually request?\n\n**Launch Velocity:** Are you shipping faster with the reduced scope?\n\n**Team Morale:** Does the team feel better launching faster?\n\nMost teams find that 60-70% of cut features are never requested. You saved months of work building things users didn't need.\n\n## When Cutting Isn't Enough\n\nSometimes you're so overbuilt that cutting features isn't enough. You need to rethink the product.\n\nSigns you need more than cutting:\n\n- Your MVP timeline is still 6+ months after cutting\n- Core features are too complex to simplify\n- You've built the wrong product entirely\n- Technical debt makes cutting impossible\n\nIf cutting doesn't get you to a launchable MVP in 8-12 weeks, consider a pivot or rebuild.\n\n## Final Thought\n\nOverbuilding happens. The question isn't whether you've done it—it's whether you'll fix it.\n\nUse the [Overbuild to MVP Reducer](https://krischase.com/overbuild-reducer) to get a systematic cutting plan. Stop the bleeding, trim scope, and launch. Every day you delay is a day you're not learning from users.\n\nCutting features feels like failure, but launching late is the real failure. Launch with less, learn from users, then build what actually matters. That's how great products are made.",
